### Inspired by the [BiggerShip](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Caverne/BiggerShip/) mod. I've gone and made it worse. You can now set the scale values yourself. 

## Required to work
#### The line in ***BepinEX.cfg*** must be set as such: 
### ```HideManagerGameObject = true```
##### I recommend aquiring [SpaceShipDoor](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Wolf11221/SpaceShipDoor/) and/or [LethalPipeRemoval](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Hamster/LethalPipeRemoval/) since there will be invisible walls preventing you from entering the bigger area. 
##### Mod is currently cosmetic only, trying to figure out how to also adjust the area you can put loot in the ship. 
##### It's best to do scaling at company building, you could fall infinitely in outer space.
