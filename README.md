# Inspired by the [BiggerShip](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Caverne/BiggerShip/) mod. I've gone and made it worse. You can now set the scale values yourself. This mod will spam errors. You have been warned. 

## Required to work
The line in BepinEX.cfg must be set as such: HideManagerGameObject = true

#### If the errors bother you. You can get this: [Disable Unity Logs](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Mhz/DisableUnityLogs/) or [NoConsole](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/KennyCreations/NoConsole/) NoConsole replaces the BepInEx.cfg file.

#### Recommended to get [SpaceShipDoor](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Wolf11221/SpaceShipDoor/) since there will be invisible walls preventing you from entering the bigger area. 

#### Mod is currently cosmetic only, trying to figure out how to also adjust the area you can put loot in the ship.
